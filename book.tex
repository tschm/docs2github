for six months.

I have noticed that although academics use an arsenal of modern tools they often 
barely scratch the surface of the capabilities of git, docker, python, and many other tools.

In this book I would like to introduce them to a whole new world. The world of DevOps
is a huge jungle but here joke with the path

This book is not exactly written for seasoned software engineers. It's more a guide
for students and researchers to achieve their goals faster and in a more robust way.

We assume readers have created an account on GitHub. 
When you create your account we recommend to go for ssh key exchange.

Many concepts carry over to GitLab. 

\section{A workflow for LaTeX documents}
Being a mathematician I tend to write essentially all documents in LaTeX.
I upload the *.tex file

It's not a good idea to push the compiled paper (or any other frequently changing binary data) 
on the main branch of the repo. At the same time we want that our fellow students and colleagues
can read our paper. 

We introduce a GitHub workflow compiling the LaTeX document




We add to the .gitignore file
We post the draft branch

And we add a link to the README file
