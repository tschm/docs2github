# DevOps for academics

My goal is to show you programming paradise or at least the door to it or the
place at the start of the track leading towards the door (or the ... you get recursion now).
Let's not be too ambitious given that those notes shall serve only as an introduction
to a field today called DevOps.

In 2023 I had the pleasure and privilege visiting Stanford's convex optimization
group led by Prof Stephen Boyd.

I have noticed that although academics use an arsenal of modern tools they often
barely scratch the surface of the capabilities of git, docker, python, and many other tools
that could support their research.

This book is not exactly written for seasoned software engineers. It's more a guide
for students and researchers to achieve their goals faster and in a more robust way.
We follow mainly one path through the jungle. There are many such paths and our goal
is **not** to build a systematic map of them.

Here we share a collection of recipes that have worked for us.

We assume readers have already created an account on GitHub.
GitHub is at heart of our efforts to automate and to robustify otherwise tedious tasks.
Although many concepts carry over to GitLab we bypass this option for now.

Of course, you are free to use Windows. We would highly recommend working directly with
Linux.
